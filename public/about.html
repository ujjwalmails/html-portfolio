<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and thank you for checking my profile! I am a Digital Marketing and Salesforce consultant with over 15 years of experience. 
  I am currently based out of Canada.</p>

<p>I have created this blog to share what I know and also to keep notes of things that I think are important and I may again need them in future. 
  Everyday I reference and learn from blogs of other trailblazers and I am hoping my writing will be able to help a few as well. 
  In this blog, I share not just my professional experiences and technical projects, but also the insights and stories that I believe can help and inspire others. </p>

<p>I love reading, travelling and I am a lifelong learner. I have changed careers and moved to different fields and countries. 
  Beyond my professional life, I am a dedicated husband and a father to two wonderful children. 
  My family is my world, and I cherish every moment spent with them.</p>
